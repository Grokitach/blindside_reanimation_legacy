==============Grok's Ballistic Overhaul Recoil Patch==============

- Use this patch if you want to use my recoil instead of Grok's enhanced recoil in B.O.

- Just overwrite the "grok_bo_enhanced_recoil.script" file or place this patch above Groks B.O. in mod manager.

==============Vanilla Weapon Stats==============

- Removes the "rebalance" part of the mod and maintains the original Anomaly weapon characteristics. Mostly involves recoil changes.

- **I RECOMMEND TRYING MY MOD WEAPON CHANGES FIRST**
